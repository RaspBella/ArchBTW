# ArchBTW
Just another Arch Linux install script but made by me.
---
**To install**
- While in Arch ISO
- ```yes | pacman -Sy git && git clone https://github.com/RaspBella/ArchBTW.git && cd ArchBTW && ./install.sh```
---
Had some trouble after updating command under **To install** so what I have it as now will have to do
